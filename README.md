# AI-Gmail-Attachment-Renamer-Automation-Make.com-Gemini-

ðŸ”¹ Goal

To automatically process incoming Gmail attachments by using AI (Gemini) to generate descriptive filenames, upload files into Google Drive, and log results into Google Sheets â€” removing manual steps and ensuring audit-ready file management.
ðŸ”— Workflow Demo (Make.com): 

ðŸ”— Google Sheets Log (Sample)

ðŸ”¹ Problem It Solves

Manual effort: No more downloading, renaming, and re-uploading attachments.

Inconsistent filenames: AI ensures meaningful, standardized file naming.

Lost files: Files are auto-organized into the correct Google Drive folder.

Poor tracking: Google Sheets log provides full traceability (timestamp, old/new filename, type, link).

Workflow inefficiency: The automation replaces repetitive admin tasks with a clean, end-to-end process.

ðŸ”¹ Project Goal

Build a Make.com workflow that:

Detects incoming Gmail attachments

Uses Gemini AI to analyze content (PDF, XLSX, CSV â€” excluding Google Docs due to API limits)

Generates a descriptive filename automatically

Renames and uploads the file to a specified Google Drive folder

Logs details (timestamp, original filename, new filename, type, link) in Google Sheets

Optionally sends a summary email after processing
